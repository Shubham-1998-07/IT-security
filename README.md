## 1. Identity Security

Identity Security ensures that every digital identity—human or machine—is authenticated, authorized, and monitored. It's a critical approach that uses privileged access management to protect access to sensitive data and systems.

> “Secure every identity, everywhere.”

## 2. Confidentiality

Confidentiality prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data. It’s especially vital for government, military, and business sectors to protect information such as trade secrets, medical records, and personal user data.

## 3. Integrity

Integrity ensures data remains unchanged unless altered by authorized users. It's essential for maintaining trust in digital systems and preventing errors, fraud, or unauthorized updates.

## 4. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC restricts system access based on user roles. For example, only IT admins can install software, while managers may access only department-level data.

 Key Benefits:
- Enforces least privilege
- Simplifies user management
- Enhances auditability

## 5. Single Sign-On (SSO)

SSO allows users to log in once and gain access to multiple systems without re-entering credentials. While convenient, it also increases the importance of secure password management and MFA.

## 6. Proxy Servers

Proxies act as intermediaries between users and the internet. They help:
- Mask user identity (anonymity)
- Block harmful content
- Cache data for faster browsing

## 7. Firewalls

Firewalls filter incoming and outgoing network traffic to block unauthorized access. Next-generation firewalls also track users, applications, and behaviors for enhanced protection.

## 8. Real-World IT Security Breaches

 **Aadhaar (India, 2018)**  
*Over 1.1 billion citizens’ data exposed due to unsecured APIs.*

 **LinkedIn (2021)**  
*Data from 700 million users scraped and published.*

 **Facebook (2019)**  
*533 million accounts compromised—phone numbers and personal info leaked.*

## 9. Conclusion

Security is not a one-time task but a continuous commitment. By implementing principles like identity verification, access control, and secure data practices, we can protect digital ecosystems from ever-evolving threats.
